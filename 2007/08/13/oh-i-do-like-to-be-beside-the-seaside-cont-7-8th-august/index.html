				<p>Just to let you know that the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/1102829312/in/set-72157601405988104/">sea and the sand on the Atlantic coast </a>is wonderful. But you definitely need a bodyboard or surfboard. Shame that you can&#8217;t fit either of those on the back of a bike very easily. But we had fun jumping the waves and going Whooooooooooo! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! oh-my-gaaaawd! Here is a lovely <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/1101980199/in/set-72157601405988104/">picture of us</a> looking stylish on the beach&#8230;I think we could get a part in Baywatch as the strange foreigners, don&#8217;t ya think?!</p>
<p>The sea by Lacanau Oc√©an is really quite dangerous though&#8230;apparently one guy had been killed on Sunday because of the strong currents. Hence lots of Baywatch style lifeguards hanging around.</p>
<p>It was lovely falling asleep on the sand and having time to read a bit&#8230;.and it did me good to think a little bit about what to do in ol&#8217; Blighty when we come back (tbc)&#8230;.Answers on the back of a postcard please to: Any ideas, PO BIKE 30.</p>
