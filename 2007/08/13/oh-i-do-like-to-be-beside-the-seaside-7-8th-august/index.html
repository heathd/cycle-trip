				<p>We promised ourselves at least a couple of days on the sand and by the sea&#8230;so we had a good lie-in and headed off to Arès accidentally coming across their weekly market. So a good hour later, we cycled off with bags full of Provençal bread (with big fat olives in it), juicy tomatoes and a new book (which I still haven&#8217;t started to read&#8230;).<span id="more-22"></span></p>
<p>We followed the road around the edge of the Bassin d&#8217;Arcachon&#8230; unfortunately the roads were really busy and we couldn&#8217;t see the bassin so it wasn&#8217;t really much fun until we turned off to the small oyster-villages of le Canon and l&#8217;herbe. There was a little sandy shore and people swimming beside the boats so we stopped for a picnic and then happily fell asleep in the sun&#8230;.hmmmm. I didn&#8217;t think we would but the sun came out and we swam for a while in the water which was really refreshing and relaxing. It was idyllic.</p>
<p>We looked around l&#8217;herbe&#8230;lots and lots of dégustations of oysters which we didn&#8217;t do (did we miss anything?!) and then we cycled really really fast to make sure we got to Andechon les Bains to meet Paul Miller, a friend from London who happened to be out on holiday in Bordeaux. It was great to catch up with Paul and chew the fat over some crèpes and hot chocolate. We stayed the evening in Andechon and got take-away pizza so we could sit and look out over the bassin. The mudflats and all the stranded boats twinkled in the end-of-day sunlight and although the pizza was well and truly cold it tasted good.</p>
