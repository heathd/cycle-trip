				<p>We headed off out of Bordeaux along the river early and stopped by the Lac de Bordeaux to have breakfast and watch the beach-cleaners rake the sand in preparation for the bathers. Bordeaux may even beat Lyon in having a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/1101944007/in/set-72157601405988104/">more beautiful city centre </a>and a big lake on the edge which you can sail and swim in. <span id="more-21"></span></p>
<p>The day started off really drizzly and we followed another cycle path, this time through lots of pine forest. When the rain started more heavily we stopped for a second breakfast (it&#8217;s gotta be done!) just outside Saumos. Warm porridge and lots of hot tea helped get us ready to face the rest of the ride and we headed into Lacanau, which seemed like a really horrible little traffic-ridden town. Having circled the town we went south to Le Porge and crossed the path of a mother and son who were doing a cycle trip together but with the craziest of gear. They had done their best in Decathlon (cheap sportshop in France that everyone uses&#8230;a bit like JD Sport perhaps) and she was pulling along a very heavily-loaded and unsteady trailer whilst her son had a round, 2&#8243; tent strapped to his back (looking a bit like a butterfly). Respect to them as it looked like damn hard work!</p>
<p>We stopped for lunch in Le Porge and went to the Mer et Forêt campsite in Lège Cap Ferret. I somehow managed to leave and therefore lost Dave&#8217;s watch in the shower&#8230;hmm still feeling guilty about that. Dave feel asleep and I cooked good pasta! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</p>
