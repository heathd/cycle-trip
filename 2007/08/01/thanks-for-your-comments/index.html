				<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>just moderated a few more comments. Thanks so much it&#8217;s lovely to hear from you. Just so you know .. the first time you add a comment Sam and I have to approve it. After that your comments will go straight up on the website. This is not because we don&#8217;t trust you! It&#8217;s just to avoid comment spam which is unfortunately wide-spread.</p>
<p>Please keep sending us messages&#8230; we really appreciate them!</p>
<p>Lots of love Sam and Dave xxx</p>
