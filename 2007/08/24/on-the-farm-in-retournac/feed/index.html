		<description>Sam and Dave,
3 weeks ago we met in Sauges in front off a 'supermarché'. That day after again (cold en a bit wet) in Cayres. Nice moment to cheer-up that day. And after that day the sun began to shine a lot. Really! The last week off my holiday was verry hot (a bit too...) 
Now already working 1,5 week....

How are you? Already moved to England? Verry bussy I guess...
It was verry nice meeting you guys!

Love,
Lucianne</description>
