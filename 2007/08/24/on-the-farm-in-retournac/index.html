				<p>Just a quick note to say that Sam and I have arrived at Les Fromentaux in Retournac, the organic goat farm where Sam and I worked last summer. It&#8217;s really nice to be here and see our friends Réné-Jo and Dédé, and to have a chance to rest our legs after three hard days of climbing (yesterday into Puy en Velay I think we climbed non stop for 20kms).</p>

			<p>Sam and Dave,<br />
3 weeks ago we met in Sauges in front off a &#8217;supermarché&#8217;. That day after again (cold en a bit wet) in Cayres. Nice moment to cheer-up that day. And after that day the sun began to shine a lot. Really! The last week off my holiday was verry hot (a bit too&#8230;)<br />
Now already working 1,5 week&#8230;.</p>
<p>How are you? Already moved to England? Verry bussy I guess&#8230;<br />
It was verry nice meeting you guys!</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Lucianne</p>
