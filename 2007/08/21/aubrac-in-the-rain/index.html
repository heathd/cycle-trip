				<p>We&#8217;ve been heading gradually further eastwards, and are now in the region called <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrac">Aubrac</a>. This is is a high plateau is part of the Massif Central, with landscape (and weather) reminiscent of Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Our journey up to the plateau started yesterday (Sun 20th Aug) in Entragues sur Truyère (alt. 238m), a pretty, old town at the confluence of the Truyère and Lot rivers. We woke up  around 7am to a grey, drizzly day, and started slowly. After packing up the tent and getting some provisions in the town it was already 0930 before we began the climb.</p>
<p>The first 4 km to Banhars took us gradually up above the Truyère, with beautful views of houses perched on the steep valley sides. We stopped at Banhars in a nice little café to eat our breakfast. At 1030 there were already a couple of old men started on the glasses of wine, one of whom insisted that we help him translate a letter he had received in Dutch.</p>
<p>We had mentally prepared ourselves for a tough day, knowing that we would have a lot of climbing to do, but in the end it was quite gradual, and we sustained around 10km/h most of the way up to St Amans des Cots (alt. 755m) where we had arranged to meet our friend Valerie for lunch. I know Valerie from the choir I sang with in Lyon, and she had come to join us (by car) for a few days.</p>
<p>We arrived at St Amans around 1220, and popped into the Spar for a few provisions. A very tanned man came up to us in the shop and asked &#8220;does your bike work?&#8221;. We weren&#8217;t quite sure what to say, but explained that we were having a good time riding it. He was riding with his family - wife and four children, and were heading westwards. Unfortunately one of his daughters had fallen from her bike recently, and had stitches on her chin.</p>
<p>We ate lunch with Valerie in a café in St Amans, and set off around 1500 for Laguiole. More climbing, always tougher after lunch, and the weather turning worse. With the increasing cold and drizzle, we couldn&#8217;t really appreciate the stunning countrside which we were passing through. Thankfully we had the beautiful pink heather all along the road to keep us company.</p>
<p>We arrived in Laguiole around 1720 tired and wet, and popped into the tourist office to find out about campsites, and enjoy the warmth! There was a great exhibition of photos next door and we bought several pictures.</p>
<p>RUN OUT OF TIME .. TO BE CONTINUED</p>
