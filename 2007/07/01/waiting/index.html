				<p>We&#8217;re still waiting for the delivery of our Pino. We had hoped to have it two weeks ago, but due to a mix up with the importer it&#8217;s still not there (the order was passed on to the manufacturer late).</p>
<p>We decided to slacken things off a bit and go up to Annecy next week to collect it from <a href="http://www.m5france.com/">M5 France</a>, rather than trying to fit in the Jura ride this week on our normal bikes.</p>
