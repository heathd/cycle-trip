		<description>Yo dudes, glad the bike is all sorted, and you have managed to get mobile despite the delays. Hope the weather is better over there than here, as have had hailstorms and all sorts over the last few days.

Bike looks well cool. How's the handling? Is it as weird as it looks?  No doubt you are getting the hang of it hope not too many prangs!!

Have looked into the dates and flights, trains, ferries etc to come over and cycle with you. It is looking pretty tricky and fairly pricy too unfortunately. I have a couple of calls to make to the train people as their search thing does not seem to work that well.

Anyway will let you know. Enjoy the cycling you lucky things!!

		<description>Wow. What a cool bike ! Sounds like you'll have an amazing trip.

Me and Susie just cycled down from Amsterdam to Dunkerque along the coast after a frisbee tournament which was ace. But: check the prevailing wind direction - going against it (as we did) is a killer !!!!

See you soon guys
