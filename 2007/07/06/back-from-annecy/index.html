				<p>Just got back home from Annecy. Bike was predictably delayed further, and finally we got the bike on Thursday afternoon. Many thanks to Jean-Pierre at M5 for putting the bike together super-quickly and loaning us the shop Pino while we waited, so we could start getting used to it.</p>
<p>Anyway, more info and some photos to follow soon.</p>
