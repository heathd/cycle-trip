				<p>Horrah! New freewheel in place and we&#8217;re off on the train to Avignon!</p>
<p>We arrived in Avignon on Friday 20th and met some really lovely people on the train and off the train. <span id="more-14"></span>First, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/903833148/in/set-72157601017736351/">Damien</a>, a sapeur-pompier who lives in Valence. He somehow manages to travel to Valence to fire-fight and look after his five month old son in Valence. His recommendation for our tour was to visit the Haribo (sweetie) factory in Uzes!</p>
<p>Off the train and into the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/903018411/in/set-72157601017736351/">festival hullabaloo</a> of Avignon (the theatre festival in July is renowned). Outside the tourist office we met <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/903778166/in/set-72157601017736351/">Gwen, Cora and Marco</a>, actors and musicians from Switzerland and Italy who were preforming at the festival for the first time. They were loving the craziness of the festival.</p>
<p>We danced <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/903799478/in/set-72157601017736351/">sur le pont d&#8217;Avignon</a> and wandered around the side-streets of Avignon to watch a Japanese dragon dance and some jazz musicians. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/903817946/in/set-72157601017736351/">pont d&#8217;Avignon</a> is v impressive: it was built in the 14th century when the Pope was based in Avignon. It was almost one kilometre long and had <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/902960805/in/set-72157601017736351/">23 arches</a>! Now it only has five or so. People used to be scared of crossing it because the Rhone is so wide and the wind blows through with a force.</p>
<p>Our campsite looked a bit like that at Reading festival. And so we really didn&#8217;t get much sleep thanks to the drunken yoofs who screamed every five minutes all night long&#8230; <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /></p>
