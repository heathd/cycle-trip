		<description>Spoke to Hase this morning. They are going to send a replacement wheel (ie. which includes the hub and free-wheel). This is good, since I was worried the hub may have been damaged as well. However, it will be the same model free-wheel, so hopefully it was just a manufacturing fault in the old free wheel.

		<description>Dear S&#38;D,
Love the blog but really bad news about the freewheel.  I assume that Hase will be refunding your expenses fixing it and paying for the better quality one you get fitted.  Hope the weather improves!!

Lots of love
