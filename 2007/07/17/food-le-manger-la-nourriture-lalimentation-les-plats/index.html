				<p>Nous sommes gourmands! Et donc je vais vous décrire les choses qu&#8217;on aime manger en vélo&#8230;</p>
<p>One of the best things about cycling lots is you can eat like a Trojan. Or at least you can claim that you need to eat like a Trojan. So we&#8217;ve been doing our best to keep France&#8217;s boulangeries in business&#8230;<span id="more-12"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/819289777/in/set-72157600836576765/">Best pain au chocolat</a> (Dave&#8217;s favourite)&#8230;can&#8217;t decide&#8230;they were all good apparently, best flan definitely munched (by Sam) at the end of the week&#8217;s ride outside the train station in Ambérieu-en-Bugey.</p>
<p>Best lunch spot - Chatillon (tiny village in-between Champagnole and Lons-le-Saurier). We had a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/820146976/in/set-72157600836576765/">great view over the hills</a> and were sheltered by a big chestnut tree. Lots of wildlife&#8230; we spotted a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/820151806/in/set-72157600836576765/">dangerous-looking snake</a> and then halfway through lunch a real Black Beauty horse broke free from its field and started trotting down the road looking for its mate&#8230;and causing confusion amongst the cars!</p>
<p>Best campsite food - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/819251297/in/set-72157600836576765/">Thai curry cooked on our trusty trangia</a>. All you need is some creamed coconut&#8230; I think I might start a campsite cookbook&#8230;</p>
<p>Best (and only) restaurant food - Tuesday night having spent all day in the rain the patron of &#8216;Le Relais Médiéval&#8217; in Nozeroy made us a cheese fondue that really did help us get over being drenched and knackered. We tasted the vin jaune, the local speciality, which is like sherry. Fondue was a welcome relief after initially being offered a plate of vegetables and bread (horray for vegetarianism in France?!)</p>
<p>Best coffee spot - Saturday morning on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/820266744/in/set-72157600836576765/">balcony</a> of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/819397569/in/set-72157600836576765/">Auberge du Pont at Thoirette</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/820268330/in/set-72157600836576765/">overlooking the River Ain</a>. In the sunshine&#8230; great pain aux raisins, good coffee and stunning river.</p>
<p>Best wine - a great whooping €2.80 Pinot Noir from Casino Géant</p>
<p>Best tipple - thank you to SiSi for my hip-flask and to Kate and Justin for the lovely Macallan whisky which was a real eau de vie in the rain and cold&#8230; <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Best beer - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidheath/819353253/in/set-72157600836576765/">at the end of the ride chez nous</a>, of course!</p>

			<p>Salut! Ca va? Love the site. If you feel the need to tak a little short-cut on your epic journey you could do worse that take a tip from the early Tour pioneers, as described in the excellent book: &#8216;A moustache, poison and blue glasses: tales of the Tour de France&#8217; by Sven Nordrup. </p>
<p>See you in September. Toodle Pip!</p>
