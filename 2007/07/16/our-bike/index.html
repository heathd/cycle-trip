In case you didn&#8217;t know what the Hase Pino looks like, here it is! I don&#8217;t remember the name of lake shown in the background. I&#8217;ll have a check later.</p>
<p>I weighed all our bags when we got home out of curiosity. This was done using me standing on bathrooms scales and holding each bag in turn. Not very accurate, but gives an order of magnitude. We had the following:</p>
<p>* green pannier 1: 4.5 kg<br />
* green pannier 2: 5 kg<br />
* trailer chassis: 5 kg<br />
* trailer bag and contents: 14 kg<br />
* red pannier: 6 kg<br />
* camelback (without water): 2kg</p>
<p>which makes a total of 36.5 kg of luggage. We plan to see if we can cut down enough to take 4 panniers plus a bag strapped on top of the rear rack and leave the trailer behind. This automatically saves us 5kg which is very welcome. But we&#8217;ll probably have to lose around 5kg of real stuff as well.<br />

			<p>Hey guys. Reckon you should be able to get down to four panniers plus stuff strapped on top - that&#8217;s what me and Susie always manage with including taking our tent. Bungie cords are a great thing - you can strap on loads more on top of your panniers then (coats, food etc.). I&#8217;ve seen some people take a small rucksack with those cool air backs so you don&#8217;t get too sweaty for odd bits and bobs. But I&#8217;m not a fan. Have fun !</p>
