		<description>Hey guys. Reckon you should be able to get down to four panniers plus stuff strapped on top - that's what me and Susie always manage with including taking our tent. Bungie cords are a great thing - you can strap on loads more on top of your panniers then (coats, food etc.). I've seen some people take a small rucksack with those cool air backs so you don't get too sweaty for odd bits and bobs. But I'm not a fan. Have fun !</description>
