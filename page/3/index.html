					<p>Our last few days in the Jura were excellent. The trip down the Gorges de l&#8217;Ain was stunning and we were only a whisker away from the Tour de France (which went past Bourg en Bresse).</p>
<p>I think we are blessed because our freewheel only finally gave in one kilometre from the station at Amberieu en Bugey.</p>

					<p>The first few days in the Jura tested our patience and sense of humour but the last three days were fantastic. The sun came out Thursday and continued to toast us (in a nice way) until Saturday. We binned the Lonely Planet suggested rides and went in hunt of a new freewheel instead. It was more fun being masters of our own destiny and choosing our own routes.</p>
<p>Thursday morning we set off from Nozeroy fairly early. But before we got cycling we made a cycle-changing discovery. My peddles were too far away from me&#8230;Uhoh! I had been peddling with all my force but only using my calf muscles&#8230;woops! No wonder Dave was absolutely exhausted after the previous rides. <a href="../../2007/07/17/the-jura-in-the-sunshine/index.html#more-11" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

In case you didn&#8217;t know what the Hase Pino looks like, here it is! I don&#8217;t remember the name of lake shown in the background. I&#8217;ll have a check later.</p>
<p>I weighed all our bags when we got home out of curiosity. This was done using me standing on bathrooms scales and holding each bag in turn. Not very accurate, but gives an order of magnitude. We had the following:</p>
<p>* green pannier 1: 4.5 kg<br />
* green pannier 2: 5 kg<br />
* trailer chassis: 5 kg<br />
* trailer bag and contents: 14 kg<br />
* red pannier: 6 kg<br />
* camelback (without water): 2kg</p>
<p>which makes a total of 36.5 kg of luggage. We plan to see if we can cut down enough to take 4 panniers plus a bag strapped on top of the rear rack and leave the trailer behind. This automatically saves us 5kg which is very welcome. But we&#8217;ll probably have to lose around 5kg of real stuff as well.<br />

					<p>Well, as Sam said, it wasn&#8217;t only our legs complaining yesterday. Halfway up the 2.5km climb out of arbois, the rear free-wheel started sticking. When I stopped pedalling the freewheel and chain continued turning fowards, eventually jumping free. VERY BAD sign considering we had another 55km to go. Somehow we eventually made it to Nozeroy, with the freewheel skipping occasionally and sticking. <a href="../../2007/07/11/the-freewheel/index.html#more-9" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>So it&#8217;s day 3 and it hasn&#8217;t stopped raining since we left Lyon. Quel horreur!</p>
<p><em><strong>Day one </strong></em>We left Besançon on Monday lunchtime&#8230;very glad as no problems taking the bike on the train. We started cycling about 5pm on Monday once the hail storm (!) had stopped.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s ride was really beautiful. We followed the new cycle route along the river Doubes. In spite of the rain, the river, the birds and the lush green fields were peaceful and relaxing. The final 20kms were hard work and I&#8217;m sure Dave was secretly hoping my legs were like Arnold Schwarznegger&#8217;s. <a href="../../2007/07/11/taking-on-the-jura/index.html#more-8" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Just got back home from Annecy. Bike was predictably delayed further, and finally we got the bike on Thursday afternoon. Many thanks to Jean-Pierre at M5 for putting the bike together super-quickly and loaning us the shop Pino while we waited, so we could start getting used to it.</p>
<p>Anyway, more info and some photos to follow soon.</p>

					<p>We&#8217;re still waiting for the delivery of our Pino. We had hoped to have it two weeks ago, but due to a mix up with the importer it&#8217;s still not there (the order was passed on to the manufacturer late).</p>
<p>We decided to slacken things off a bit and go up to Annecy next week to collect it from <a href="http://www.m5france.com/">M5 France</a>, rather than trying to fit in the Jura ride this week on our normal bikes.</p>
